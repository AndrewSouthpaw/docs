### Pro Plan Updates

The Twilio SendGrid Pro plans have changed—new price, new features.

You can review past invoices and update your Plan and Billing Details in the SendGrid application.

Essentials content: Effective December 1st, 2018 our Essentials and Bronze plan prices have changed. Essentials 40K/Bronze is $14.95 and Essentials 100K is $29.95. This price increase will ensure we continue to provide customers a best-in-class experience as well as support ongoing innovation.

Please note, this pricing is already in effect for new customers, but existing essentials customers’ January bills will reflect these changes. The features included in the Essentials plan and prices of add-ons are not changing. You can review past invoices and update your Plan and Billing Details in the SendGrid application. If you have any questions please reach out to our knowledgeable support team.
