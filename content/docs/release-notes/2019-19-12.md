### Email Content Testing for Dynamic Templates

Test your email content against spam filters, validate hyperlinks, and preview HTML rendering across browsers and devices with Email Testing for Dynamic Templates. Monthly testing credits included for Trial, Pro and Premier plans, with additional credits available for purchase. See our Email Testing [documentation]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/email-testing/) for more details.

### Designs API

We’ve added a brand new Designs API, allowing you to easily create, edit, download, or delete Email Designs without relying on the SendGrid app UI. You can use the Designs you’ve created across all of your Twilio SendGrid Email—from Automations, to Single Sends, and Dynamic Templates. For more about working with the API, see our [API Reference](https://sendgrid.com/docs/api-reference/).
