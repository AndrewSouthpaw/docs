Twilio SendGrid’s Marketing Campaigns provides a built-in image editing tool that allows you to crop, flip, and filter your photos. This article provides an overview of the editor and its features with additional tips to make your images look their best.

## Editing images

To access the image editor, open the image library and upload a new image or select a pre-existing image that you would like to edit. Click the "Edit" button to open the image editor.

Once in the image editor, make any desired adjustments and click the "Save" button. A new image will be added to your image library with the saved adjustments. If you’d like to abandon your changes without creating a new image, click the "Cancel" button.

Cropping an image can change its composition to help communicate your story. Common guidelines for framing and cropping images include the [rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) and the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio#Applications_and_observations).

</call-out>

- Freeform: crop the image to any desired width and height
- Landscape: crop the image with a fixed 4:3 aspect ratio
- Portrait: crop the image with a fixed 3:4 aspect ratio

#### Flip and rotate

- Rotate: rotate the image 90 degrees
- Flip Horizontally

### Filter

The Filter tab allows you to apply preset adjustments to the image. The provided filters can help quickly alter a photo to create a look and feel without manual adjustments.

### Adjust

The Adjust tab allows you to manually alter multiple image settings. These manual adjustements can be used to modify an unedited photo or to further refine a look after you have applied a filter.
