The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) establishes legal requirements for any organization that processes the data of EU [natural persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person). Additionally, the GDPR provides rights to individuals with respect to their personal data. The requirements and rights set by the GDPR apply to both EU and non-EU organizations when they process the data of EU individuals.

## The Intent of the GDPR

The GDPR is meant to provide people with greater control over their personal data and ensure the protection of that data. But what is **personal data**, and how is **processing** defined?

### Processing

Processing is not limited to transferring or altering data. Processing includes data collection, storage, deletion, and other forms of handling. Data processing can be understood to mean any use of personal data.

### Personal Data

Information that can be used to identify a natural person is considered personal data. An individual’s name, passport number, fingerprint, phone number, and birthdate are just a few examples of personal data.

## GDPR Requirements

### Information for Senders

Of particular importance to email marketers is the requirement to obtain consent from individuals when processing their personal data. This means that the folks on your mailing list must agree to be on that mailing list, and you must keep an up-to-date record of that consent.

If you need only an email address to achieve your specific business purpose, an email address is all you should store. The GDPR requires that you process only the data necessary for a specific task and nothing more. All this processing must also be done securely [by design and by default](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:FULL#d1e3022-1-1).

### Controllers and Processors

The GDPR divides organizations into two categories: controllers and processors. Controllers determine how data is used while processors handle the storage, alteration, transfer, and other forms of processing. For example, if you maintain a large email marketing list that uses SendGrid to deliver promotions, you’re considered a controller. SendGrid is your processor. You set the business purpose and control the data. SendGrid processes that data on your behalf.

Many businesses are both controllers and processors. You can read more in [Chapter IV](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:FULL#d1e3022-1-1) of the full GDPR legal text. We also have a [blog post](https://sendgrid.com/blog/general-data-protection-regulation-what-senders-need-to-know/) with more detail about what you need to know as an email sender.

### The Rights of Your Customers

The GDPR is meant to provide rights to natural persons. For this reason, your customers may request that their data be erased, corrected, made available to them, or transferred to another service. As a controller, you must comply with these rights. When communicating with individuals, they also have a right to receive that communication in plain and transparent language. For more about the rights of a data subject, see [Chapter III](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:119:FULL#d1e2161-1-1) of the full GDPR text.
