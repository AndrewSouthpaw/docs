## Test data available in the Design and Code Editors

Both the Marketing Campaigns Design Editor and Code Editor now support test data. Test data allows you to render Substitution Tags using sample values directly in each Editor's preview window. By providing test data, you no longer need to send a test email to ensure that your dynamic data will be displayed properly.

For more information on using test data in Marketing Campaigns, see our [Design and Code Editor documentation]({{root_url}}/ui/sending-email/editor/).
