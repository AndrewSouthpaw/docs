SendGrid now collects sales tax in several US states and metro areas (see below for more details). We assign tax jurisdiction by the billing address you have in our system. If your billing address is in one of these jurisdictions, and you don't have 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, you will see a line for sales tax [on your invoice]({{root_url}}/ui/account-and-settings/reading-your-invoice/). For more information about declaring your tax-exempt status, see [Declaring tax-exempt status](#declaring-tax-exempt-status).

To determine whether to add sales tax to your monthly SendGrid bill, we use the address you enter as your billing address in [Account Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/account/billing) in the SendGrid UI.

 ### 	Where can I see how much I am getting charged for sales tax each month?

If you are being charged sales tax, you will see it as a line item on your invoice. Youâ€™ll be able to find the new sales tax line item by navigating to [Account Details](https://app.sendgrid.com/account/billing) in the SendGrid UI, then by viewing your invoice, which is in PDF form.

 ### 	Can I get an estimate of my sales tax?

Unfortunately, we cannot provide estimates of sales tax for an individual customer ahead of time. The taxes assessed could change monthly for various reasons such as state or local tax laws changing. You can check your bill throughout the month for an estimate of your sales tax.

 ### 	Will my tax amount vary from month to month?

Taxes charged can vary month-to-month based on local tax laws changing, or if your product mix causes your bill to be greater or less than in previous months.

 ### 	How does SendGrid calculate the sales tax owed?

Tax laws change regularly, so we work with a third party software that focuses on deeply understanding local and state tax laws. SendGrid uses this software to calculate the sales tax you are charged each month.

 ### 	Other questions?

If you have any other questions about taxes, send an email to billing@sendgrid.com.
